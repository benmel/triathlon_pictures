triathlon_pictures
==================

This is Ruby on Rails web app that can be used to scrape pictures from race picture sites. After a triathlon, marathon, etc., you get a link to a site that shows your race pictures. If you don't want to pay for every picture (which can be really expensive), I thought it would be helpful if an app could scrape medium size pictures or thumbnails from the pictures site. This app takes a URL to a pictures site, and then returns a page with just the pictures. This means that a racer's pictures can easily be downloaded. Each photography site needs custom logic to scrape pictures, so not all sites may be supported.

To do
- Add more tests
- Improve interface
- Allow user to store pictures in account
